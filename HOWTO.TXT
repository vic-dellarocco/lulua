# Lulua howto.

Lulua includes source code for everything, but you don't need to
distribute the source. When it is time to distribute your
program, make a script that copies the libraries, binaries,
scripts and LICENSES to some output dir. Remove any modules that
you don't need. You might even only distribute obfuscated
bytecode of your lua scripts. There are only two requirements
for distributables:

1. It has to work
2. I has to comply with the source code licenses.


## How to add a module the quick and dirty way:

Just drop the .lua and .so files into the main lulua directory.


## How to do it right:

Make a directory for your module.

Edit these files:

	COPYRIGHT  -- add copyright info of the new module.
	Makefile   -- add build and test targets for your module.
	init.lua   -- add the module path to path or cpath vars.
	stdlib.lua -- update the doc generator.
	README.MD  -- add a mention of the new module.

Then regenerate docs:

	make lua && make docs

This will produce a new stdlib.docs.txt file.

Write your git commit message into the COMMIT_MESSAGE file and
then run:

	make commit

If you follow the examples of the special comments in the
makefile, then the makefile documentation will be automatically
generated.


## How to remove a module the quick and dirty way:

Erase it.


## How to do it right:

Erase it. Then remove every mention of it.
