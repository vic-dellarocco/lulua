LuaNcurses v0.02
Jesse Luehrs (jluehrs2@uiuc.edu)

OVERVIEW
========
LuaNcurses is a wrapper around the ncurses library for terminal programming. It aims to expose the ncurses library in a way that is more natural to Lua programmers, rather than just be a thin wrapper around C function calls. It is currently rather incomplete, but most basic functionality is available.

INSTALL
=======
This module requires Lua 5.1 and the ncurses library. To install, modify the Make.config file with paths appropriate to your system and run 'make' and 'make install'.

DOCUMENTATION
=============
None yet, but hopefully the included tests should be explanatory enough for now. Real docs should be available in a later release.

CHANGES
=======
0.02
- Lots of cleanups
- Portability fixes - should build properly on OS X now, among other things

0.01
- Initial basic implementation
