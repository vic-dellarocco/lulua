                ===================

Lunitx is a unit testing framework for lua, written in lua, 
based heavily on Lunit 0.5, but modified to work with Lua 5.2

Lunitx provides 27 assert functions, and a few misc functions
for usage in an easy unit testing framework.

Lunit comes with a test suite to test itself. The testsuite
consists of approximately 710 assertions.
