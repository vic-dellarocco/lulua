Release 0.6:

	Lunit no longer depends on lunit.sh. The script moved to the
	extra-directory.
        See README.lunitx for Sam Roberts's enhancments:
        - fixed the -t switch for selecting only a single test
        - example files for using Lunit without the wrapper script
        Support for Lua 5.2 using lunit.module.
        Tests added and examples modified for lunit.module
        Bug fixes by Reuben Thomas, Joshua Haberman, and Ildar Mulyukov
        Debian packaging by Ricky Cormier

Release 0.5:

	New test function assert_error_match().
	Lunit shell script returns an error code on failed tests.
	Be more compatible with Darwin / Mac OS X.
	Bug fixes.

Release 0.4:

        Mostly complete rewrite.
        Lua-5.1 only.


Release 0.3 (alpha):

        New function lunit.wrap() to wrap a single function in a
        complete test case.

        Now a backtrace is printed, if an error or failure occurs
        in a test case.


Release 0.2 (alpha):

        The test suite consists now of approximately 630 assertions.

        Fixed an ugly bug in lunit.assert()! Testcases for lunit.assert()
        added.

        Now all assert functions return the actual value on success.
